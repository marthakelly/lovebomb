"Send a lovebomb, save the internet"

## What is lovebomb?
Lovebomb is a simple web app built with the express framework for node.js. It aggregates tweets sent to a particular user with the hashtag #lovebomb.

## How do I send a lovebomb?
send a nice tweet that mentions a twitter user (ex: @seriouspony) with the hashtag #lovebomb
ex: "@adambrault thank you for your closing keynote at #jsconfeu. Now I believe this industry can 1) change itself 2) change the world #lovebomb"
ex: "@garanm you supported me through a really hard time. If it weren't for you I would have given up. You're really amazing <3 #lovebomb"

## Why did you build this?

The way you treat people is more important than the code you write, the opinions you have, or the job title you hold. I mean seriously, have you given much thought to *life* beyond getting recongition for the inconsequential details of software`*? It's as simple as that. As it stands now, people are being turned away from the technology community because of hostility, shame, or fear. I don't fit the "traditional" MO (modus operandi) of a programmer and, honestly, the least interesting people in my life do. I'd like to change that.

This app might not be much, but it doesn't have to be. As Adam Brault said in his "People First" JSConfEu keynote, "there are no premature optimizations recommended."

Together we can drown out the darkness with the light. You have unrestricted access to ~554,750,000 *human beings* on Twitter, use it for good.

`*I nerd out about that stuff as much as you. I just mean, in the grand scheme of things, as long as your software is working, secure, and reasonably fast (in that order) you're probably fine.

Thanks to Adam for inspiring me so deeply, and to Angelina Fabb:ro for the name!
